A project I did to learn Android programming. 

Includes: 
Parsing XML and Json data from the internet,
GET/POST request to the internet and fetching received data (using Retrofit2),
Room library, 
smart use of RecyclerView, 
implementation of light and dark theme,
MediaPlayer and more.

The app shows latest news from News 12, and the user is able to choose specific topic of news he wants to view.
Also the app shows the top apps and music from itunes store, and is able to play a preview of the selected song.
The user can also track packages using the Israel Post site- the app saves searched packages and updates them when user enters the app or refreshes it (TO-DO: add a background service to update saved packages and notify user about updates).
